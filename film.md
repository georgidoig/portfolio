With a passion for film spanning the entirety of life, I was thrilled to study the craft of film making for three years at the Art’s University Bournemouth.

There, I learnt the art of producing, which I put into practice on a number of short films including ’S Wonderful, a Parisian based musical, People LTD, a humanisation of the halal slaughter progress and Our Eyes Beneath, an indie romance showcasing the music of producer, Orca.

I also developed skills as a production manager and AD, working on films that have entered festivals across the continent. Each film has allowed me to expand my skillsets across the many processes of film production, preparing me for the industry work I have taken on in more recent years.
